MAI-DxO is an interactive, AI-powered diagnostic tool that implements the concepts from Microsoft Research's "Sequential Diagnosis with Language Models" paper. It simulates a virtual panel of physician-agents to perform iterative medical diagnosis, now with a human-in-the-loop interface for real-time clinical evaluation.

This project provides two modes of operation:
1.  **Autonomous Mode**: The original simulation that runs a full diagnostic process based on a complete, hidden case file.
2.  **Interactive Mode**: A new turn-based Streamlit application where a human physician provides clinical findings in response to the AI's requests.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive Turn-Based UI**: A Streamlit application that allows physicians to guide the diagnostic process.
- **8 AI Physician Agents**: Specialized roles for comprehensive, multi-faceted diagnosis.
- **Session Persistence**: Save, load, and resume diagnostic sessions.
- **Transparency Panels**: View the detailed reasoning of each AI agent at every turn.
- **Differential Diagnosis Timeline**: Visualize how the diagnostic probabilities evolve over time.
- **Markdown Export**: Generate a complete, shareable report of any session.
- **Autonomous Benchmark Mode**: Run the original simulation for research and evaluation.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Interactive Mode

### 1. Setup

Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Swarm-Corporation/Open-MAI-Dx-Orchestrator.git
cd Open-MAI-Dx-Orchestrator
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
python scripts/install_dependencies.py
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys. The application will prompt for keys if they are not found.

```sh
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open with the MAI-DxO interactive interface.

## üî¨ Autonomous Mode

To run the original autonomous benchmark simulation:

```bash
python3 example_autonomous.py
```

This will run a full diagnostic session in your terminal based on the pre-defined case in the script.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The Virtual Physician Panel

MAI-DxO employs a multi-agent system where each agent has a specific role:

- **üß† Dr. Hypothesis**: Maintains the differential diagnosis.
- **üî¨ Dr. Test-Chooser**: Selects the most informative diagnostic tests.
- **ü§î Dr. Challenger**: Prevents cognitive biases and diagnostic errors.
- **üí∞ Dr. Stewardship**: Ensures cost-effective care.
- **‚úÖ Dr. Checklist**: Performs quality control checks.
- **ü§ù Consensus Coordinator**: Synthesizes panel decisions into a single action.
- **üîë Gatekeeper**: (Autonomous Mode) Acts as the clinical information oracle.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Judge**: (Autonomous Mode) Evaluates the final diagnostic accuracy.
